### Description
For this homework, we were tasked with linking a Mongoose DB with an existing frontend and providing proper routing so that the app was functional. To complete this, I simply setup my local mongodb server, created internal navigation using index.html as the base, then created post,get, and put routes to pull data from mongo. 

### Installation Intstructions
  To ensure proper setup, please install the following packages: 
  * Mongodb
   
 To install the entire project, simply download the .zip folder from github or pull directly from the repo. 


### Usage 
  N/A
  
### Contribution
  Anyone is welcome to contribute to the fitness tracker.
  
### Test Parameters
 There are no test suites associated with my project. Instead, run npm start to ensure that the server is live and functional on your device.
